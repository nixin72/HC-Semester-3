second portion of the course is all going to be individual work

Weak Entity:
An entity who's primary keys come from the primary keys of other entities.  
So either associative entities whose key comes from the keys of the two entities it's relating, 
or subtypes, whose primary keys come from their parent entity.

2 types: suptypes and associative entities

Every table has a primary key. By definition of an RDBMS

role of a primary key in a database: 
    When coming up with a database you make a list of candidate primary keys.
    A key uniquely identifies a row. 
    Associative entities use compond keys, two different attributes that make up a unique key.
    
Surrogate key
    A surrogate key has no meaninging in the real world. It's just an arbitrary number. 
        No matter what, the surrogate key WILL NOT change.
    
Intelligent Keys:
    Something that comes from a real world unique attribute, like your SIN number. 
        Something meaningful. (my permanent code is DUMP08049803 (or something like that)),
        it's an Intelligent key about me. 
    Gender, firstname, lastname, etc., they're all things that can be changed. 

When things change over time:
    product (prod_id, prod_price, etc.)
    
    how do you keep a record of that history?
    Make another entity that holds the history for that key.
    
    product (prod_id, etc.) 
    product-price (prod_id, prod_price) <---- Weak entity
    
    Like finding the kennel log for any given date. 
    
Generalization:
    Taking many entities and making them into one. 
        -Opposite of specializing
        
    Dog (dog_id, dog_color, date_of_birth, etc)
    Cat (cat_id, cat_color, date_of_birth, etc)
    
    ^^^^
    Pet (pet_id, pet_color, date_of_birth, pet_type);
    
Specialization: 
    Opposite of generalization. Taking the Pet entity and turning it into the 
        cat entity and the dog entity.
