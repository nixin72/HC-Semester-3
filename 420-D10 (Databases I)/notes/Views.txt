Presenting: Views
- Dynamically create tables from real underlying tables
- Remember all those reports from last lab???
- Abstract the SQL away from the table user.

Example: 
	CREATE VIEW teacher_coordinator_view
		(facultyid, NAME, phone, status)
			AS (
				SELECT.....
			
			)
	
	List the id, name, phone number and status of all faculty who are 
	either a department coodinator or who are not teaching

	You can create a 'fake' table based on a select query
	
Benefits: 
	Users don't have to know the underlying tables	
	Users can be restricted from knowing the actual database schema
	Control what users can/cannot see
	Abstract the SQL away from table user.
	
Actions:
	Create - has a read-only option
	Update 
	Drop
	Alter
	
Example:
	The user of the new view can use it as any other table
		SELECT * FROM teacher_coordinator_view
