Completion
	- data type
	- Sequence: health card number
	- check digit: SIN number 
	- Limit: Min OR Max
	- Range: Min TO Max
	- consistency: confirm email or password
	
Design principles
	- Layout
	- Content awareness: grouping related content together
	- Aesthetics 
	- User friendly
		- novice likes it easy to learn
		- expert likes it easy to use
	- Consistency 
	- Minimize user-effort
	
Path to completion:
	- Primary goal for every form is completion
	- Every input requires consideration and action 
		- remove all unnessessary data requests
		- Enable flexible data input 
		- Enable smart defaults
	- Provide a clear path
	
Layout-  Label Alignment: 
	- Top, left or right aligned
	TOP:
		- When data is being collected is familiar
		- Minimize time to completion
		- Require move vertical space
	RIGHT: 
		- Clear association between label and field
		- require less vertical space
		- Fast completion times
	LEFT: 
		- When data required is unfamiliar
		- Enables label scanning 
		- less clear association between label and field
		- require les vertical space 
		- Changing label length may impair layout
		
	Label alignment practises:
		- for reduced completion times and familiar data: TOP
		- when veritace space is a constrain: RIGHT
		- When data is unfamiliar: LEFT
		
Validation: 
	Provide real time feedback
	- validate inputs
	- suggest valid inputs
	
	required fields
		- indication of required fields is most useful when...
			- there are lots of fields but few are required

Progressive disclosure 
	- Not all users require all available options all the time
